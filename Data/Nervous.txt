<h1>Emergency Toolbox</h1>

<p>There are only two basic impulses toward a situation:
<p>We can close ourselves up in order to protect ourselves, or we can open up and face the situation.
<p>The key in challenging moments is often genuine interest in the situation and non-judgmental attention.
<p>If we then choose to trust the process, we are fully present and in the moment.

<p>With the following mantra you can shift into an open attitude at any time and approach a situation in a non-judgmental way:

<h2>Curiosity - Trust - Joy</h2>


<h3>Action:</h3>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions in preparation for challenging situations:</h2>

<p>What is there to be curious about?

<p>On what can I trust in this situation? And which helpful skills can I rely on?

<p>What kind of experience could I be having that would even bring me joy?
<p> ---
<p>Carry the mantra with you into your day.
