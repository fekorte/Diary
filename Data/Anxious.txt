If you adopt a self-confident posture - <i>a so-called Power Pose </i> - for only 2 minutes, you'll reap the following benefits:
<p>- the testosterone level in your blood increases significantly (= higher self-confidence)
<p>- your cortisol level decreases significantly (= less fear and stress sensitivity)
<p>- you become more willing to take risks
<p>- your sensitivity to pain decreases
<p>- you are able to think at a more abstract level
<p>- and the probability increases that you will cope well with very stressful situations, such as a job interview.
<&nbsp>
<p>This has been proven by studies at Harvard Business School and other universities.

<h2>Action:</h2>
<p>Get into a self-confident posture. This means putting your hands on your hips or casually clasping your hands behind your head with your arms wide open.
<p>Stand or sit with legs wide apart.
<p>The posture should feel expansive and confident.
<p>Think of an alpha or a superhero.

<p><i>Hold it for about 2 minutes.</i>
