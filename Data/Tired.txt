<h2>If you are tired but can't find any sleep:</h2>

<p>When you focus on two perceptions at the same time, your mind can no longer be preoccupied with thinking.

<h2>Action: </h2>
<p>Direct your attention to two different body sensations.

<p>Examples:
<p>- The sensation in your nose as your breath flows in and out
<p>- Your belly, how it rises and falls
<p>- The beating of your heart in your chest
<p>- Or how it feels where your back touches the ground
