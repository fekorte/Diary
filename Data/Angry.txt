<h1>The Wolf Show</h1>

<p><i>from the world of 'Nonviolent Communication' according to Marshall B. Rosenberg</i></p>


<h2>Action 1 - Self-empathy - after a situation that was stressful for you.</h2>

<p>1) Write down all thoughts without censoring them. What made you angry or sad, annoyed, frustrated, confused...? Write freely, this part is for your eyes only.

<p>2) Re-Read what you have written. Which needs of yours were not met here? Write down all of them.

<p>In what ways can you take care of your needs - now, or if this situation ever happens again?
<p>Get creative, there is never just one option.
<p>The beauty of this step is: you will realize that you are less helpless and dependent on certain people than you think when it comes to getting your needs met. Most of the time, we are totally fixated on a favorite strategy that also depends on another person (e.g., "He better behave differently!").


<h2>Action 2 - Prepare to talk to the other person, if necessary.</h2>

<p>1) How did you perceive the situation? Describe the facts objectively, without judgment or interpretation. What did you observe?

<p>Ex: <i>"Monday morning when I walked through the door, you (dear colleague) saw me and immediately approached me with lots of questions about your current project."</i>

<p>2) Explain how this made you feel

<p>Ex: <i>"I felt irritated and pulled out of my thoughts."</i>

<p>3) and what needs were unmet in the situation.

<p>Ex: <i>"To me it is important to be able to arrive in peace and stay mentally focused."</i>

<p>4) Formulate a simple, specific request for the other person.

<p>Ex: <i>"If you want to discuss something with me, please ask me first when would be a good time to do so."</i>
