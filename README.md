# DiaryApp

This is a Diary Application in C++, written together with @AlgoArtee and @KaZebra.

The user can:

- create, add and delete different diaries
- create, add, edit or delete entries, or special travel entries
- create/choose multiple topics for normal entries
- choose their current mood
- receive helpful prompts and ideas if the selected mood is bad 
- in the normal entry (not a travel entry) an assigned mood value is stored together with air quality data (one-hour-mean) 
  from the Umweltaundesamt - UBA API (Bremen Mitte sensor). HINT: a little patience is required when saving the entry,
  while data is being retrieved (Not a bug, a feature!). 
- Track their mood, and compare it to air quality values in Mood Tracking

- be creative!
